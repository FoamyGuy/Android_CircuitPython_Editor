# Android Circuit Python Editor
If you are just trying to use the app and your device has access to the [Google Play Store this link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foamyguy.circuitpythoneditor) is the easiest way to get it installed.

To learn how to use the app check out the guide on [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-the-android-circuitpython-editor)

This app serves as a USB serial terminal for Circuit Python boards. With it you can:
 * see the output of code running on the board.
 * access the REPL and issue python commands to get executed on the board.
 * use a rudimentary code editor to load and save the main.py file on the board.

[See the Hackaday Project page for more info.](https://hackaday.io/project/162561-android-circuit-python-editor)

### Your Circuit Python board must have it's storage mounted as writable in order for the save function in this app to work! [See the guide to learn how to set it up](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foamyguy.circuitpythoneditor)
