# Android Circuit Python Editor

This app serves as a USB serial terminal for Circuit Python boards. With it you can:
 * see the output of code running on the board.
 * access the REPL and issue python commands to get executed on the board.
 * use a rudimentary code editor to load and save the main.py file on the board.

### Your Circuit Python board must have it's storage mounted as writable in order for the save function in this app to work! [See here](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-storage)
